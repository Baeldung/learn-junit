# About this repo

This is the codebase of the **Learn JUnit** course.

If you're already a student of the course you can start exploring this through the lesson notes in the course.

Note that the code for each module is hosted on its own branch, you'll have to switch to the branch corresponding to the module you're on, for example: `git checkout module1`
